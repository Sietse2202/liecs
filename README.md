**Lightweight ECS library in Rust**
---
And with lightweight I mean it. This is made for the Numworks Calculator, which allows apps to use 128kb of static memory, and 32kb of stack memory and no heap. This is also heapless for that exact reason.

**Ergonomics**
---
I tried to have it be as ergonomic as I could, this is just a small personal project for now. Might make it more usable in the future.

*Also I can make no guarantees if this works, there might be bugs, but as I said, this is for my own personal project for now.*
